Working with iSyntax files
===========================

I you are like me and are stuck with iSyntax files, then they first need to be converted to TIFF. The following script
will parse the isyntax file to make a config file and a BigTiff file.

First, change directories so you are in the isyntax directory of this repo , and download an example iSyntax file from
the `Phillips Website`_.

.. _`Phillips Website`: https://www.openpathology.philips.com/resources/

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd isyntax
   $ curl -o ex1.isyntax  https://www.openpathology.philips.com/wp-content/uploads/AnimalSlides/1.isyntax


Next, get the Phillips SDK. You need to create a _`log in` first.

.. `log in`_ https://www.openpathology.philips.com/login/

You will need to follow ithe installation instructions for your specific operating system.  Once you have it installed,
open a python terminal and run:

.. code-block:: python

    import pixelengine

If you get `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pixelengine'` then you do not have this installed properly. Ask Phillips tech support for help.



Once you have the Phillips SDK installed, you can run the conversion script.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python isyntax_to_tiff.py --input 1.isyntax --tif BIGTIFF --sparse 0  --startlevel 0

This will create a file called `ex1_BIG_sparse.tiff`.

Now you can create the configuration file and proceed as normal.
